      <u>My husband next door by Catherine Alliott</u><br />When Ella married
      the <b><i>handsome</i></b
      >, celebrated artist Sebastian Montclair at just nineteen she was madly in
      love. Now, those <b><i> blissful</i></b> years of marriage have turned
      into the very definition of an <b><i> unconventional</i></b> set-up.
      Separated in every way but distance, Sebastian resides in an outhouse
      across the lawn from Ella's ramshackle farmhouse.
