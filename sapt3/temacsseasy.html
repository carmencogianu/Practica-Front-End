      <p>
        Water lilies are a well studied clade of plants because their large
        flowers with multiple unspecialized parts were initially considered to
        represent the floral pattern of the earliest flowering plants, and later
        genetic studies confirmed their evolutionary position as basal
        angiosperms. Analyses of floral morphology and molecular characteristics
        and comparisons with a sister taxon, the family Cabombaceae, indicate,
        however, that the flowers of extant water lilies with the most floral
        parts are more derived than the genera with fewer floral parts. Genera
        with more floral parts, Nuphar, Nymphaea, Victoria, have a beetle
        pollination syndrome, while genera with fewer parts are pollinated by
        flies or bees, or are self- or wind-pollinated.[3] Thus, the large
        number of relatively unspecialized floral organs in the Nymphaeaceae is
        not an ancestral condition for the clade.
